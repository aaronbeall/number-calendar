## Issues
- [x] System color mode doesn't match light/dark selection
- [ ] Chart days are off by 1 (timezone offset?)
- [ ] Chart is missing numeric formatting, rounding, etc
- [ ] Order of numbers in months/years is not necessarily correct (sort by date first)
- [ ] Current date is wrong when left open overnight, etc
- [x] Negative year summary has green
- [x] [High] Hide weekends is causing June 2026 days to be wrong
- [ ] Deleting a prior day numbers does not update deltas (changing normally it does)
- [x] The daily grid is hard-coded to Sun-Sat week, but weekly data keys use locale weeks which may be Mon-Sun
- [ ] The Monthly view day scale is wrong, because yearExtremes is by month, not by day. Need the daily extremes for the whole year.
- [x] Normalize UUIDs
- [ ] Week/Month/Year summaries need hover and selected state
- [x] Can't delete all data on a day anymore
- [x] [High] Week keys/dates are wrong, it doesn't line up with actual calendar days
- [ ] Tracking=series and deltas and percents aren't very helpful, period total is already a delta, and percents should be based on cumulative change, not change from prior delta -- will need to add cumulatives source (which itself is useless for tracking=trend)
- [ ] Adding data data to new month didn't update the monthly view show a new month summary
- [ ] Need and error boundary to catch UI errors
- [ ] Need suggested goal weight, meaningful suggested values throughout
- [ ] Edit badge from numbers panel doesn't work -- replace with "Manage Achievements"
- [ ] Expand Range based achievements
- [ ] Count and average achievements
- [ ] "First Win" is kinda broken -- fix or remove
- [ ] Delete note confirmation disappears -- replace menu item with button
- [ ] Changing passed data can shift streaks/multi-count achievements, triggering their notification -- may need to use number id -- partial mitigation by obnly norifiying on current period changes
- [ ] Overlapping same category achievements (X-day streak, X-target, etc) should be stacked
- [ ] Refactor to use unified data manager instead of individual data hooks
- [ ] Dashboard month trend delta (valence) is wrong, but after opening the data is right -- needs priors
- [ ] Updating goal requirements should replace title/description/label, use word boundaries and formatted matchers
- [ ] [Minor] Generated goal text has extra whitespace (renders fine)
- [ ] Maintain template with created dataset for goal builder -- add way to get to generic goal builder
- [ ] Optimization -- component memo and data calc caching
