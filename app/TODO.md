## Bugs
- [ ] System color mode doesn't match light/dark selection
- [ ] Chart days are off by 1 (timezone offset?)
- [ ] Order of numbers in months/years is not necessarily correct (sort by date first)
- [ ] Re-render on page activation to sync with current date
- [x] Negative year summary has green
- [ ] Hide weekends is causing June days to be wrong
- [ ] Deleting a prior day numbers does not update deltas (changing normally it does)
- [ ] The daily grid is hard-coded to Sun-Sat week, but weekly data keys use locale weeks which may be Mon-Sun
- [ ] The Monthly view day scale is wrong, because yearExtremes is by month, not by day. Need the daily extremes for the whole year.
- [ ] Normalize UUIDs
- [ ] Week/Month/Year summaries need hover and selected state
